<h2>Call for papers</h2>
The DL workshop is the major annual event of the description logic research community. It is the forum in which those interested in description logics, both from academia and industry, meet to discuss ideas, share information and compare experiences. We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics, including, but not limited to:

<b>Foundations of description logics</b>: decidability and complexity of reasoning, expressive power, novel inference problems, inconsistency management, reasoning techniques, modularisation, ontology extraction, abductive and inductive reasoning

<b>Extensions of description logics</b>: closed-world and non-monotonic reasoning, epistemic reasoning, temporal and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge, query answering, reasoning over dynamic information

<b>Integration of description logics with other formalisms</b>: object-oriented representation languages, database query languages, constraint-based programming, logic programming, rule-based systems

<b>Applications and use areas of description logics</b>: ontology engineering, ontology languages, databases, ontology-based data access, semi-structured data, graph-structured data, linked data, document management, natural language, learning, explanations, planning, Semantic Web, cloud computing, conceptual modeling, web services, business processes, practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies

<b>Systems and tools of all kinds around description logics</b>: reasoners, ontology editors, ontology alignment, ontology extraction, other support for ontology development, database schema design, query rewriting/answering/optimization, data integration, implementation and optimization techniques, benchmarking, evaluation, modeling.

<h2>Submissions</h2>
Traditionally, the DL review process follows a single-blind model, where reviewers can see the authors’ names. Therefore, for standard submissions, please include author names in your submitted files. However, if you have a specific reason to remain anonymous, you may opt for the anonymous (i.e., double-blind) submission option instead. The new submission platform---HotCRP---supports both options, allowing authors to select their preferred review model during the submission process (see <a href="/assets/images/hotcrp.png">screenshot</a> for reference).


<h4>Submission Categories</h4>
Submissions within the scope of the workshop are invited in one of the following formats:
- Regular Papers: Up to 11 pages (excluding references)
- Extended Abstracts: 2 to 4 pages (excluding references).

All submissions must follow the CEURART formatting style using our DL-specific template <b>TBD</b> and submitted through <a href="https://submissions.floc26.org/dl/">HotCRP for DL 2026</a>.

<b>Regular Papers</b>
- Must provide substantial contributions that can be cited in other publications.
- Should not have been previously published or be under submission elsewhere.
- May include an appendix with additional proofs, evaluation data, or other relevant content.

<b>Extended Abstracts</b>
- Should ideally include an appendix with additional proofs, evaluation data, or an extended version of the paper.
- If the abstract is based on a paper accepted or under review at another venue, the authors must clearly state the venue and the paper’s status.
- The appendix is optional and will be reviewed at the discretion of the reviewers, but it will not be included in the proceedings.
- Unlike the main submission, the appendix does not need to follow the CEURART format.
    
<b>Presentation Selection</b>

Accepted submissions (both regular papers and extended abstracts) will be considered for oral or poster presentations at the workshop. The selection will be based solely on content quality, not on the type of submission.
